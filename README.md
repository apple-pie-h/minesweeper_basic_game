This is a simple mindsweeper game with 3 levels (Easy, Hard, Medium). The code was generated fully using ChatGPT. 

# Controls:

Left-click / Tap a cell to reavel it.
Right-click / Long-press a cell to place or remove a ðŸš© flag (mark suspected bombs).
Use the Restart button to begin a new game.
Choose difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard) to adjust grid size and bomb count.

# How to Play:

Click a cell to start the game. The timer will begin.

 If the cell:

   ðŸ’¥ Has a bomb â†’ Game Over!

   ðŸŸ¦ Has a number â†’ It tells how many bombs are in adjacent cells (up to 8).

   â¬œ Is empty â†’ It automatically reveals surrounding empty and numbered cells.


   Use flags (ðŸš©) to mark where you think bombs are. Flags donâ€™t stop you from clicking, but they help you keep track.

# Winning Condition

You win when all safe cells (non-bomb cells) are revealed.

The number of flags is for your referenceâ€”you don't have to flag every bomb to win.
